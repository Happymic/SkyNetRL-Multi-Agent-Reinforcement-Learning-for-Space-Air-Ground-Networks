## Overview

SkyNetRL leverages the power of Multi-Agent Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (MADDPG) to tackle the complex challenge of optimizing Space-Air-Ground network deployments. By simulating a dynamic environment with multiple types of network nodes (satellites, UAVs, and ground stations), SkyNetRL aims to maximize coverage of Points of Interest (PoIs) while managing energy constraints and network connectivity.

## Key Features

- **MADDPG Implementation**: Utilizes the Multi-Agent Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient algorithm for efficient multi-agent learning.
- **Customizable Environment**: Flexible simulation of Space-Air-Ground networks with adjustable parameters.
- **Energy-Aware UAV Management**: Incorporates UAV energy constraints into the optimization process.
- **Dynamic Coverage Optimization**: Continuously adapts network configuration to maximize PoI coverage.
- **Graph-Based Communication Model**: Employs a sophisticated graph-based approach with multi-head attention mechanism for agent communication.
- **Visualizations**: Provides tools for visualizing network coverage and agent behaviors.

## Installation

To set up SkyNetRL, follow these steps:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/SkyNetRL.git
cd SkyNetRL

# Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended)
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`

# Install required packages
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

To run a training session:

```bash
python main.py
```

To customize the training parameters, modify the `config.py` file before running.

For evaluation of a trained model:

```bash
python evaluate.py --model_path path/to/saved/model
```

## Customization

You can customize various aspects of the simulation and training process:

1. Modify environment parameters in `config.py` (e.g., number of agents, area size, coverage ranges).
2. Adjust MADDPG hyperparameters in `config.py` (e.g., learning rates, discount factor).
3. Implement new reward functions or state representations in `sag_env.py`.

## Results and Visualization

SkyNetRL provides visualization tools to help you understand the network's performance:

- Coverage maps showing PoI coverage over time.
- Agent movement trajectories.
- Performance metrics graphs (e.g., average reward, coverage percentage).

To generate visualizations:

```bash
python visualize.py --results_dir path/to/results
```
